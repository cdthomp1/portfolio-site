## Main Features 
### Keep track of your filament usage
By adding information on your filaments, you can easily see how much filament is left on the spool. When you add a new print, the length and weight will automatically be subracted from the filament data.
### Keep track of your print settings 
By adding print settings information, you can easily keep track of which settings are workin the best for you and which bring you heartache.
